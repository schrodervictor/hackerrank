# [Update List]
Authored by idlecool on Jul 04 2013

## Problem Statement

Update the values of a list with their absolute values. The input and output portions will be handled automatically during grading. You only need to write a function with the recommended method signature.

## Input Format

There are N integers, each on a new line. These are the N elements of the input array.

## Output Format

N integers each on a new line; these are the absolute values of the input list, in that order.

## Sample Input

```
2
-4
3
-1
23
-4
-54
```

## Sample Output

```
2
4
3
1
23
4
54
```

## Constraints 

The list will have no more than 100 integers. The list will be composed of integers X such that -100 <= X <= 100.

## Recommended Method Signature

* Number Of Parameters: 1
* Parameters: [list]
* Returns: List or Vector

## For Hackers Using Clojure

This will be the outline of your function body (fill up the blank portion marked by underscores):

```
 (fn[lst]___________________________)
```

## For Hackers Using Scala

This will be the outline of your function body (fill up the blank portion marked by underscores):

```
 def f(arr:List[Int]):List[Int] = __________________
```

## For Hackers Using Haskell

This will be the outline of your function body (fill up the blank portion marked by underscores):

```
f arr = ___________________
```

## For Hackers Using other Languages 

You have to read input from standard input and write output to standard output. Please follow input/output format mentioned above.

Please note that you only need to submit the code above, after filling in the blanks appropriately. The input and output section will be handled by us. The focus is on writing the correct function.
