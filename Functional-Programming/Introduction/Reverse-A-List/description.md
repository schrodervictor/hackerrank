# [Reverse a list]
Authored by idlecool on Jul 04 2013

## Problem Statement

Reverse a list without using reverse function. The input and output portions will be handled automatically. You need to write a function with the recommended method signature.

## Input and Output Format

Each element of the list is displayed on a new line.
The output list is the reverse of the input list.

## Sample Input

```
19
22
3
28
26
17
18
4
28
0
```

## Sample Output

```
0
28
4
18
17
26
28
3
22
19
```

## Method Signature

* Number Of Parameters: 1
* Parameters: [list]
* Returns: List or Vector

## Constraints

List will have N elements, 1&lt;=N&lt;=100.
Each element X will be such that 0&lt;=X&lt;=100.

## For Hackers Using Clojure

This will be the outline of your function body (fill up the blank portion marked by underscores):

```
 (fn[lst]___________________________)
```

## For Hackers Using Scala

This will be the outline of your function body (fill up the blank portion marked by underscores):

```
 def f(arr:List[Int]):List[Int] = __________________
```

## For Hackers Using Haskell

This will be the outline of your function body (fill up the blank portion marked by underscores):

```
 rev l = __________________
```

## For Hackers Using other Languages

You have to read input from standard input and write output to standard output. Please follow input/output format mentioned above.

Please note that you only need to submit the code above, after filling in the blanks appropriately. The input and output section will be handled by us. The focus is on writing the correct function.
