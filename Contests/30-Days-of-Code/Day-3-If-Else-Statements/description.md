# [Day 3: If-Else Statements!]

## Problem Statement

Welcome to Day 3! Check out [a review of if-else statements here], or just jump right into the problem.

Using "if-else" you can perform decision making in your code. See the flowchart below (taken from wikipedia):

This problem will test your knowledge on "if-else" statements.

Given an integer `N` as input, check the following:

If `N` is odd, print "`Weird`".
If `N` is even and, in between the range of 2 and 5(inclusive), print "`Not Weird`".
If `N` is even and, in between the range of 6 and 20(inclusive), print "`Weird`".
If `N` is even and `N>20`, print "`Not Weird`".

We have given you partially completed code in the editor, complete it to solve the problem.

## Input Format

There is a single line of input: integer `N`.

## Output Format

Print "`Weird`" if the number is weird. Otherwise, print "`Not Weird`". Do not print the quotation marks.

### Sample Input 1
```
3
```

### Sample Output 1

```
Weird
```

### Explanation

`N=3`, is odd hence the its a Weird Number.

### Sample Input 2

```
24
```

### Sample Output 2

```
Not Weird
```

### Explanation

`N=24`, is >20 hence its not a Weird Number.
